	<h1>Pedigree Programs</h1>
	<p>Here is a list of all the programs we use and need. The naming convention is a little strange from Mark, so we'll see what will happen!</p>
	<p>The first thing we need to do is turn a dot matrix file into a nice looking pedigree.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Source File to RTF File <a href="toRTF.html">Start Here</a></li>
		<li>Run through search</li>
		<li>Turn a written pedigree into a PDF</li>
		<li>Merge a lot of text files into a single file</li>
		<li>Sire Blurbs</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There are more, but that's all I could think of right now.</p>
