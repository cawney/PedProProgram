	<h1>Time to turn a source pedigree into an RTF</h1>
	<p>This is where we are going to change a source pedigree into an RTF file.</p>
	<p>The steps for this are fairly simple, in my opinion:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Parse it by line</li>
		<li>Find the special characters that make something bold, and turn it bold</li>
		<li>Make sure it is indenting properly.</li>
	</ul>
